# PID Controller for Ackermann Steering
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Charan-Karthikeyan/ackerman_pid.svg?branch=iteration_1_design)](https://travis-ci.org/Charan-Karthikeyan/ackerman_pid)

## Overview

A PID based controller for an ackermann steering system. A simulation of the ackermann model is also included to test the controller.

## Install UMLet

[Download UMlet files](https://www.umlet.com/download/umlet_14_3/umlet-standalone-14.3.0.zip)
```
Download file from link
unzip umlet-standalone-14.3.0.zip
cd Umlet
Run program: java -jar umlet.jar 
```

## Cpplint check
```
cd  <path to repository>
cpplint $( find . -name \*.hpp -or -name \*.cpp | grep -vE -e "^./build/" -e "^./vendor/" -e "^./docs/" -e "^./results" )
```

## Cppcheck check
```
cd <path to repository>
cppcheck --enable=all --std=c++11 -I include/ --suppress=missingIncludeSystem $( find . -name *.cpp | grep -vE -e "^./build/" -e "^./vendor/" )
```

## Doxygen File generation
```
sudo apt-get install doxygen
doxygen -g
Open Doxygen file and source file in "INPUT" prameter and add the include and app folder
Add "*.hpp *.cpp" in the "FILE_PATTERNS" parameter in the doxygen file
Run "doxygen ./Doxyfile" in te terminal
Open html folder
open index.html
 ```

## Building for code coverage (for assignments beginning in Week 4)
```
sudo apt-get install lcov
cmake -D COVERAGE=ON -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../
make
make code_coverage
```
This generates a index.html page in the build/coverage sub-directory that can be viewed locally in a web browser.

## Personal Interest 
The reason that we as a team took up this project is because of our common interrests in autonomous systems and how to control them to get the desired output from them. Ashwin has been involved in the field of drone systems development in the area of visual system and Charan has been involved in the field of Autonomous cars in the field of planning and perception and this backgrounds led us to ge into the control system behind autonomous systems. This is the reason behind us taking this project.

## Running the code
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Charan-Karthikeyan/ackerman_pid/commits/master
cd <path to repository>
mkdir build 
cmake ..
make
Run tests: ./test/cpp-test
Run program: ./app/shell-app
The program is already initailized with all the variables needed and can be run normally for a fully functional progarm.
```
